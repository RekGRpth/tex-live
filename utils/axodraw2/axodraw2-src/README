Axodraw2 is a package that defines macros for drawing Feynman graphs
in LaTeX documents.

It is an important update of the axodraw package, but since it is not
completely backwards compatible, we have given the style file a
changed name.

Many new features have been added, with new types of line, and much
more flexibility in their properties: For details see the
documentation.

In addition, it is now possible to use axodraw2 with pdflatex, as well
as with the latex-dvips method. However with pdflatex (and also lualatex
and xelatex), an external program, axohelp, is used to perform the
geometrical calculations needed for the pdf code inserted in the
output file.  The processing involves a run of pdflatex, a run of
axohelp, and then another run of pdflatex.

The files in the distribution are:
